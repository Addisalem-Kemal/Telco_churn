Telco Churn


Project Goal:

The purpose of this project is to identify various drivers of churn within Telco and predict customer's probablity of churn using machine learning methodologies.


Questions we are interested in:


When are customers most likely to churn?

Which features affect churn the most?

Is there a price threshold that increases churn per feature?

What does the churn rate look like after the 12th month?
